<h1>Project Idea</h1>

<p>The project idea is a rostering software that automatically selects employees to fill hours whilst maintaining constraints such as hours available by each employee, sick leaves, parental/carers leave, public holiday, time off requests or shift swaps, holidays and piles them up in a weekly schedule. Saving hours of admin, and scheduling work; the software also tracks the hours worked by each employee including breaks they went on through the unique key pass each employee must scan upon entering the workplace and leaving. The main feature of this idea is its AI ability to fill shift slots that may become unavailable due to sudden occurrences and recommend other employees who are available to cover the shift. This software is designed for small to medium businesses that have casual or part-time employees working shift hours that change each day. Allowing them to organise people so that they won’t be understaffed or overstaffed, through imputing limitations such as peak times, availabilities, sick leave or urgent and unexpected leave, annual leave and other implications which might affect the scheduling; with a major focus on easy-to-use user interface allowing employers easy navigation of the software without being dissimulated through its numerous options.
<br>
<br>
This project is an essential tool for small or medium businesses that have numerous employees swapping shifts or requesting absences which might leave the business understaffed. It will also assist the administrators who just spent hours upon hours scheduling and rostering employees as this software takes away the human aspect and indicates the most suitable combination of times and shifts available. Since the scheduling is done by AI who understand the needs of peak and off-peak hours and forecast this information; the prospect of human error is reduced thus the issue of overstaffing is decreased. This software also helps ease employers who must deal with no show employees as they can save time and effort through the application which provides backup staff to contact, similarly it also reduces turnover rates of employees by maintaining a consistent schedule that adheres to everyone’s availability and needs facilitates a positive culture.
<br>
<br>
This project will allow small to medium businesses who have several employees with contrasting availabilities, needs and positions, the software/application will allow them to organize and schedule rosters according to the constraints. It will also allow employers easy use to approve shift swaps, leave and time off, using AI the software will consider the businesses needs and operate around those demands. The software would also indicate the next best option for the exact purpose of backup employees in case rostered staff are unavailable, allow employers to save time and effort trying to find a cover.
<br>
<br>
To create this application a website modelling system like GitHub and a source code editor like Atom is needed; to design and construct the rostering software. Through which it will allocate shifts and responsibilities based on hourly rates, availability and personal requests made by employees. Similarly, an application version of the program would also be created through MIT app inventor, for employees to receive the live updates made by employers so that they are well informed about the work responsibilities required. As they receive push notifications about the unavailability of their co-workers; they could also request time off, or shift swap which would be directed to the manager who has the final say and would indicate through the app. As such constraints can be put in place for ineligibility for time off or shift swaps due to short notice or lack of personnel which would automatically disallow requests that are unqualified saving time and effort. AI would also be integrated into the software using an artificial intelligence framework like Open Cog, through which automated rostering can happen whilst the system understands concepts like overscheduling, understaffing, and overstaffing to efficiently operate schedules; through forecasting each business. Thus, making it customisable for each business and its operations.
<br>
<br>
Skills needed would include being able to design and program a working schedular in Atom and integrate Open Cog to understand and evaluate the best practical option for the business. As well as building an accompanying application that links to the software and is easy to use, through MIT app inventor. The major difficulty would arise from trying to incorporate all three software together so that the project can be completed to a satisfactory level. Another obstacle could be from commands that the program may not be able to understand like ‘there must be a senior on shift at all times’ or ‘there must be at least six people working at all times’, the challenge would be to make the program understand the needs of each business so that it can plan according to it.
<br>
<br>
If this project is successful employers around the world would not need to spent hours scheduling and rescheduling shifts and hours for each employee so that it matches their needs, saving them both time and effort. As the software will automatically schedule using the information provided to produce an acceptable roster that adheres to both the employees and businesses demands. This project would also reduce the chances of understaffing and overstaffing the reason for the circumstance is that the program uses AI to predict the businesses needs and operates accordingly.
