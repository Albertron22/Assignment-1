  <p>This is an accurate representation of my personality as a virtuoso is someone who learns and explores the world through their eyes, touching and examining. People with this personality type are natural Makers, moving from project to project, building the useful and the superfluous for the fun of it, and learning from their environment as they go (Introduction | Virtuoso (ISTP) Personality | 16Personalities, 2022), which embodies my take on life, as I am someone who doesn't want to the same place every day and see the same people and do the same job. However, the results from learning styles are far from the truth as the test ensued to labelling me as a visual learner. Visual learners are people who understand through reading or seeing pictures and remember things by sight. I always found myself to be more of a tactile learner who learns through repeated physical action; a “firsthand” person. This test has some inaccuracy with its questioning and database as it falsely categorized me as a visual learner. Finally, the big five tests which label and grades your answers into five categories: extroversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and intellect/imagination. From which I had the highest raw score in agreeableness, which is a trait describing friendliness and optimism, I feel as though I am more of a realistic and down to earth person trying to get by each day; this could indicate a flaw within the algorithm for this test. However, my second highest factor the emotional stability factor which tends to suggest that I am, emotionally stable, calm, and more resilient seems more in line with me and what I feel I am. Thus, the results from this personality test are giving mixed feelings as one of the two highest factors is far off while the other is a relatively accurate representation of me.
<br><br>
  These results may influence my behaviour in a team because a turbulent virtuoso person is less secure about their skills and capabilities to be in a team mainly because they are concerned about ‘fitting in.’ This is accurate, as I am always second-guessing the worth of my work compared to others and the difference in the quality of output. Moreso, turbulent virtuosos are less likely to lead a team as they do not enjoy working in teams; because of the insecurities within virtuosos, they prefer to work on their own. This innate self-doubt may hinder my ability to converse and collaborate well within a group as ISTP-T personalities are subject to social pressure. However, the big five tests indicate that a person who scores high in emotional stability is assertive and less prone to insecurities which is quite different to a turbulent virtuoso making it not very influential on my behaviour. Nevertheless, a person high in agreeableness tends to give precedence to coherence and avoid conflicts with other members thus maintaining positive relationships. These results are just computer-based tests giving scores closest to its database, they do not know me so it is very unlikely that it will affect my behaviour or attitude in a team.
<br><br>
  When forming a team, I think I should just collaborate with people who have a vision of what they want to achieve but also an open mind to others' input and opinions, and pair with others who are like-minded but can formulate ideas to practical applications. But find people whom I enjoy working together with and who have similar tastes so that we can cultivate ideas better.</p>
